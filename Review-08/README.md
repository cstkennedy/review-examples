This Review discussed ADTs.

  1. Example 1 - This is the final version of the Room Renovation Example from
     the Member Functions discussion--i.e., [Review Session 7](#cs333review7). 

  2. Example 2 - In this example I discussed two _constructors_, a _Default
     Constructor_ (no arguments) and a _Non-Default Constructor_ (with
     arguments). I discussed public versus private data members and structs versus
     classes.

  3. Example 3 - In this example I changed the _Room_ struct to a class. In
     this example I introduced _inline_ _get_ and _set_ functions--and the
     rules for making functions inline. I ended the discussion of this example with
     an analysis of different compilation errors and how to interpret them.
