During this Review, we discussed _arrays_ and _structs_. The specific
areas of interest included:

  1. Parameters &amp; Arguments
    - Pass by Reference
    - Pass by Constant Reference
  2. Structs
  3. Arrays (Parallel Arrays)
  4. Arrays of Structs
  5. Documenting Functions &amp; structs

Example 1 was our starting point. It was copied from Review 02 Example
6. Examples 2-8--included in Review-03.zip--were discussed in the context of
the above topics. The Notes directory contains the Excel document used to
visualize arrays and structs. 

Explore the documentation included with each example--click documentation.htm.
Examine the call graphs.  Doxygen--i.e., the tool used to generate this
documentation--is useful in larger programs. You are **not** expected to use
Doxygen in your own programs.
