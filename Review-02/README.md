During this Review, we discussed functions:

  1. Function Prototypes
  2. Function Definitions
  3. Parameters &amp; Arguments
    - Pass by Value
    - Pass by Reference
  4. Function Calls (Invoking Functions)
    - Individual Function Calls
    - Nested Function Calls
  5. Documenting Functions

We discussed 6 Examples:

  - Example 1 was a direct copy of Review 1 Example 5--this was the most recent
    non-function based example.

  - Example 2 introduced the `promptForDouble` and `promptForYesNo` functions.
    We briefly discussed string concatenation.

  - Example 3 introduced the `printRoomSummary` and `computeRoomMetrics`
    functions. Both functions included pass-by-value and pass-by-reference.

  - Example 4 introduced the `promptForDimensions` function.

  - Example 5 introduced the `UNITS` global constant. I briefly discussed
    scope--as applicable to global variables and functions.

  - Example 6 included some closing remarks regarding functions and attributes
    of a room--e.g., length and width.

Examine the call graphs.  Doxygen--i.e., the tool used to generate this
documentation--is useful in larger programs. You are **not** expected to use
Doxygen.
