The focus of the Review was on the following topics:

  1. Variables
  2. Input
  3. Output
  4. Output Formatting
  5. Conditional Blocks
  6. Loops

We discussed 6 examples:
  
  - Example 0 was a brief a exploration of integer and double arithmetic. 

  - Example 1 was an initial Room Renovation tool. In this example, we
    discussed variables, assignment operations, and basic output.  

  - Example 2 was an refined Room Renovation tool. We discussed user input for
    `length` and `width`.

  - Example 3 continued our refinement process. We incorporated output
    formatting--specifically, fixed decimal notation. We continued the
    discussion and incorporated units of measure and cost metrics.

  - Example 4 began our discussion of if-else blocks, loops, boolean
    expressions, and boolean variables. We used these mechanics to process
    multiple rooms--instead of a single room.

  - Example 5 built on Example 4 and incorported `setw`, `left`, and `right`
    for additional formatting.
