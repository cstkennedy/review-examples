This Review Session was recorded to supplement the materials presented Section
3.2: Modules. During this Review Session, I revisited the Room Renovation
Example from Review Sessions 2 and 3.

There are five *Example* directories:

  1. Example 1 - The final example from Review Session 3. This version exists
     as a single _cpp_ file.
  2. Example 2 - This directory contains the same example with the _Utilities
     Module_ factored out--i.e., placed in `utilities.h` and `utilities.cpp`.
  3. Example 3 - This directory contains the same example with the _Room
     Module_ factored out--i.e., placed in `Room.h` and `Room.cpp`.
  3. Example 3 - This directory contains the same example with the _Aggregate
     Module_ factored out--i.e., placed in `Aggregate.h` and `Aggregate.cpp`.
  5. Notes - This directory contains the diagrams used in the Review Session.

A recorded lecture is available [here](https://youtu.be/g64TToM3wLY).
