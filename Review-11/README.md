This Review Session served as our *Linked Lists* discussion.

  1. Example 1 - This is the final version of the Room Renovation Example from
     the Operator Overloading discussion--i.e., [Review 9](../Review-09). 
  2. Example 2 - In this example I discussed the core of the Linked List
     implementation of the `RoomCollection` class.
  3. Example 3 - In this example I discussed improvements to the Linked List
     implementation.
