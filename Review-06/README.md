This Review Session was recorded--i.e., there was no live session. During this
Review Session, I discussed [Stepwise
Refinement](../../Public/stepwise/index.html#stepwiserefinement) and [Top-Down
Design](../../Public/stepwise/#top-downdesign)

I discussed stepwise refinement for the game Tic-Tac-Toe. I then presented a
simliar example for top-down design. The top-down design was used to implement
a working Tic-Tac-Toe game.

The example code is available as Review-06.zip on the [Example
Code](../ReviewCode333/) section of the course site. Within the notes
directory, you will find three documents:
  
  * Formal Test Specification
  * Stepwise Refinement
  * Top Down Design

The tests directory contains the tests we discussed during [Review
5](../Review-05).

All of these documents were saved with Linux line endings--i.e., Windows
Notepad will collapse the file to one line. Proper Text editors--e.g.,
Notepad++, Sublime Text, nano, emacs, and vim--or IDEs will properly display
the files.

A recorded lecture is available [here](https://youtu.be/8yAkCm5tMts).
