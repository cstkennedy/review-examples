This Review Session served as our Operator Overloading Discussion. I discussed
7 examples. Examples 1 through 5 demonstrated the 
  
  - Logical Equivalence Operator, `operator==`
  - Less-Than (Comes-Before) Operator, `operator<`
  - Stream Insertion Operator, `operator<<` 

Examples 6 and 7 were included to demonstrate the number of operators that can
be overloaded. If you take CS 330 next semester (Spring 2016), you will see the
`RoomCollection` example refined to a complete ADT.
