This Review covered Member Functions. 
  
  1. Example 1 - This is the final version of the Room Renovation Example from
     the Modules discussion--i.e., [Review Session 4](#cs333review4).
  2. Example 2 - This began the discussion of member functions. In this
     example, we took two functions--i.e., computeRoomMetrics and
     printRoomSummary and rewrote them as member functions.
  3. Example 3 - In this example, we took the `computeMetrics` member function,
     `area` attribute, and `total_cost` attribute and reorganziaed them into
     the `area` and `flooringCost` cost functions.

Note that in this discussion, I did not cover Constructors. Place particular
emphasis on Constructors as you are completing your readings.
