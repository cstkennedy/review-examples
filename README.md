This repository contains a series of code examples meant to review introductory
CS material (e.g., CS 150 and CS 250). The examples are divided into groups
(i.e., *Reviews*). Each *Review* directory includes a `README.md` that:

  - links to recorded lectures
  - summarizes the focus of each *Example*

To obtain a copy of the examples, either:

  2. [Clone the repository from
     GitHub](https://github.com/cstkennedy/review-examples) and `checkout` the
     master branch
